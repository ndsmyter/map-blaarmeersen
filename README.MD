# Map Blaarmeersen

This project was created to map all the different items that can be found in the Blaarmeersen, Ghent, Belgium.
There are several items in the Blaarmeersen, but there isn't a very good map for these items yet.

The goal of the project is to add all the items in the Blaarmeersen on the map, so it can be viewed by everybody.

## Technology

The technology used to map the items is rather simple:

* [OpenLayers 4.1](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/releases/tag/v4.1.0) for the map
* [Font Awesome 4.7.0](http://fontawesome.io) for some of the icons
